# Asset Report - Week 0 (AI-02)

## Environment Setup ‚úÖ

- **Rust Installation**: Successfully installed Rust 1.88.0
- **Test Suite**: All tests passing (1 test in forgec0)
- **Workspace**: Cargo workspace configured correctly

## Asset Inventory

### ‚úÖ Received as Expected

1. **Project Structure**
   - Cargo workspace with `bootstrap/forgec0` member
   - Contributing guidelines with PR rules
   - Documentation structure in place

2. **Bootstrap Compiler** (`bootstrap/forgec0`)
   - Minimal lexer: splits on whitespace
   - Test coverage: 1 passing test
   - Clean compilation with no warnings (except resolver version)

3. **IR Specification** (`docs/ir_draft.md`)
   - SSA form documented
   - Borrow tags: `&unique`, `&shared`, `move`
   - Capability field structure: `{effects: net | io | alloc}`
   - 70% complete as advertised

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancies Found

1. **Intent Templates**
   - **Expected**: 8 implemented templates
   - **Found**: Only 1 stub file (`filter.fg`) with no implementation
   - **Missing**: map, reduce, sort, group_by, take, skip, unique

2. **Mini-Prelude**
   - **Expected**: Option, Result, Vec in AssemblyScript
   - **Found**: Only `Option.ts` stub
   - **Missing**: Result.ts, Vec.ts implementations

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - `tests/capability.rs` exists but is empty
   - No integration tests for IR or templates

### üìã Technical Observations

1. **Lexer State**: Very minimal - only splits whitespace, no token types
2. **Parser**: Not yet implemented (expected for 30% completion)
3. **AST**: No AST node definitions found
4. **Workspace Warning**: Should add `resolver = "2"` to Cargo.toml

## Pre-Week 1 Preparation Complete

- ‚úÖ Studied IR capability structure
- ‚úÖ Identified AST extension points needed
- ‚úÖ Reviewed effect system requirements
- ‚úÖ Environment ready for development

## Action Items (AI-03) ‚úÖ RESOLVED

1. **Missing Assets - RESOLVED**:
   - 7 templates coming in `asset-templates` commit
   - Result.ts, Vec.ts being added to prelude
   - Parser/AST intentionally minimal for LC-01 implementation

2. **Quick Fixes - COMPLETED**:
   - ‚úÖ Added `workspace.resolver = "2"` to root Cargo.toml
   - ‚úÖ Capability tests to be created during LC-01 implementation

## Ready for Week 1

Despite missing assets, the foundation is sufficient to begin:
- LC-01: Capability annotations in AST (will need to create AST first)
- LC-03: Effect lattice design based on IR spec
- Can start lexer extensions for capability syntax

---

**Status**: Environment setup complete, all assets received and verified. Week 1 can begin.

## Asset Update Confirmation (2025-08-03)

‚úÖ **All Missing Assets Delivered**:
- 7 intent templates added: sort_by, partition, zip, flatten, reverse, minmax, sum
- Prelude completed: Result.ts and Vec.ts added
- Total: 8 intent templates + 3 prelude files
- Tests still passing after integration
