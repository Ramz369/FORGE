[2025-08-03] Progress
- Completed: AI-01, AI-02, AI-03, ENV-01, ASSET-01 (all Week 0 tasks)
- In Progress: LC-01 (lexer extensions for capability syntax)
- Blockers: None
- Tomorrow: Complete LC-01 parser implementation and begin LC-03 effect lattice

## Today's Achievements

### Week 0 Complete ✅
- Environment setup with Rust 1.88.0
- All assets received and integrated (8 templates + 3 prelude files)
- Asset Report filed and updated
- Fixed workspace resolver warning

### LC-01 Progress (60% complete)
- Implemented full lexer with Unicode support
- Added all capability tokens (!, {}, ≤, ->, etc.)
- Created comprehensive test suite (9 tests, all passing)
- Prepared AST structures for capability annotations

### Lines of Code: ~300 (2 PRs worth)
- lexer.rs: 265 lines
- ast.rs: 69 lines
- Tests: 90 lines

### Next Steps
1. Implement parser for capability syntax
2. Add AST builder methods
3. Create effect lattice implementation
4. Round-trip tests (parse → AST → pretty-print)
