# Forge Lang Î©

[![CI](https://github.com/Ramz369/FORGE/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ramz369/FORGE/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A revolutionary programming language designed as the genetic substrate for self-evolving AI ecosystems.

## Vision

Forge Lang Î© aims to deliver **10Â³Ã— aggregate efficiency** over current software/hardware stacks through:
- **AI-first** language constructs
- **Hardware-fluid** compilation targets
- **LLM-agnostic** runtime execution

## Phase Î± Status

- âœ… Lexer with full Unicode support
- âœ… Parser with capability annotations
- âœ… AST with effect lattice
- âœ… Basic IR representation
- ðŸš§ Type checker (in progress)
- ðŸš§ WASM backend (in progress)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the bootstrap compiler
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run capability demo
cargo run --example cap_demo
```

## Example

```forge
module demo.capabilities !{energy â‰¤ 10mJ}

fn process(data: Text) -> Int !{net, io, tokens â‰¤ 100}

fn pure_compute(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int !{pure}
```
